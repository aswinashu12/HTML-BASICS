    <h3>why cats are considered as a pet ?</h3>
    <p1 style="color:cadetblue;">The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.<br> Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.<br> Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.<br> Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter.</p1>
